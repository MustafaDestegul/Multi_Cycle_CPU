# Multi_Cycle_CPU
Multi-Cycle CPU implemented in Verilog HDL.

  This project uses a custom ISA created by myself.Hence it has some restrictions. This restrictions and what you can achieve is well explained in the report. By opening top_module in Quartus 2, you can see the datapath and control unit. Additionally, in the Instruction/Data memory, you can see some example instructions which you can use with the datapath.
