# Multi_Cycle_CPU
Multi-Cycle CPU implemented in Verilog HDL.

  This project uses a custom ISA created by myself.Hence it has some restrictions. This restrictions and what you can achieve is well explained in the report. By opening Main.bsf and Main.bdf in Quartus 2, you can see the datapath. Additionally, in the Instruction/Data memory, you can see some example instructions which you can use with the datapath.
